\title{A function to build the environment for lpmec. Builds a conda environment in which
'JAX', 'numpyro', and 'numpy' are installed. Users can also create a conda
environment where 'JAX' and 'numpy' are installed themselves.}
\usage{
build_backend(conda_env = "lpmec", conda = "auto")
}
\arguments{
\item{conda_env}{(default = \code{"lpmec"}) Name of the conda environment in which to place the backends.}

\item{conda}{(default = \code{auto}) The path to a conda executable. Using \code{"auto"} allows reticulate to attempt to automatically find an appropriate conda binary.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL; this function is used for its side effects
of creating and configuring a conda environment for \code{lpmec}.
This function requires an Internet connection.
You can find out a list of conda Python paths via: \code{Sys.which("python")}
